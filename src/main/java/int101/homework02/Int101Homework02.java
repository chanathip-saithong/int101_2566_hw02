           This method receives a parameter of type "String"
           named "value" and it returns the "value" if nothing is wrong.
           However, if the "value" is null, it throws NullPointerException.
           If the "value" is a blank string, it throws IllegalArgumentException.
       1.3 Create a public method named "testPositive" in "Utilitor" class.
           This method receives a parameter of type "double" named "value"
           and it returns the "value" if this "value" is a positive value.
           Otherwise, it throws IllegalArgumentException.
       1.4 Create a public method named "computeIsbn10" in "Utilitor" class.
           This method recieves a parameter of type "long" named "isbn10", which
           consists of 9 digits from position 10 (leftmost) to position 2
           (rightmost). This method returns a value of type "long" that is
           the check-digit for "isbn10". All possible returned values are 0 to 10.
           See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_digit for ISBN-10 calculation.
